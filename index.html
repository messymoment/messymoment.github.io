        <h3>Our Project</h3>
        <p class="justify">
            Real life, like real journalism, is messy. Capturing its complexity is the mission of Messy Moment Media. We try to tell our stories through the voice of those who are seldom heard . The results speak for themselves. We’ve produced gripping nonfiction television from the world’s hotspots to its most  remote corners,  while winning 8 Emmys.
